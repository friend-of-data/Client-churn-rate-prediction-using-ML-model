# Client-churn-rate-prediction-using-ML-model
## **Overview**
```
This project is based on Google Advanced Data Analytics online courses available on Coursera.
The goal of the project is to build machine learning as well as regression model to forecast the client churn rate for Waze, a company providing navigation services to users.
Please note while Waze is a real company, the data shared by Coursera/Google here is soly for pedagogical purpose, which is also explicitly stated within Coursera platform.
I will show with this project the following skillsets that I have obatined:
```
* EDA (exploratory data analysis)
* Data visulization
* Statitical analysis of the data and regression analysis (Logistic regression)
* Machine learning model (Decision tree, random forest, XGBoost
```
The programming language is Python, including the following liabraries/ packages or modules therein:
```
*pandas
*numpy
*matplotlib
*seaborn
*sklearn
*scipy
*statsmodels
